# Assignment 1 Intelligent Robotics

In this assignment, Tiago needs to use the /move_base topic to navigate through the environment, reaching a pre-defined pose.
There, it will use the information coming from its LiDAR to detect the coordinates of the circles in the environment.
We also implemented manually a control law that allows the robot to navigate through a narrow corridor. 

The code and report for the assignment can be found in this repository.

Here there is a demo video reporting of the code simulated by Gazebo: https://youtu.be/CdgzhNrMeBU

And this is a test of the control law to show that Tiago is able to correct its position and navigate without collision in the narrow corridor: https://youtu.be/ncYRmdhC2no
